This folder contains C++ programs to find basic feasible solutions for a system of equations.

A sample problem might be to find basic feasible solutions for the following problem:

2 x + y ≥ 20;
3 x + 4 y ≥ 50;
x + 2 y ≥ 20;
x, y ≥ 0

The solution introduces slack variables and then solve the problem using Gauss Elimination Method.
